# 🔐 User-Specific Access Control Implementation Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

Your **Talk to Your Document** application now has comprehensive user-specific access control implemented. Authenticated users can only view and interact with their own documents.

---

## 🚀 **What Was Implemented**

### 1. **Authentication Requirements**
- **✅ All document endpoints now require Firebase authentication**
- **✅ Users must provide valid Firebase ID tokens**
- **✅ Unauthenticated requests return 401 Unauthorized**

### 2. **Document Ownership Validation**
- **✅ Added `validate_document_ownership()` helper function**
- **✅ Validates user owns document before any operation**
- **✅ Returns 403 Forbidden if user tries to access others' documents**
- **✅ Returns 404 Not Found if document doesn't exist**

### 3. **Updated Endpoints**

#### **📋 Document Management**
- `GET /documents` - List user's own documents only
- `GET /documents/{document_id}` - Get specific document (with ownership check)
- `POST /documents/upload` - Upload document (requires auth, assigns to user)
- `DELETE /documents/{document_id}` - Delete document (with ownership check)

#### **🤖 AI-Powered Features**
- `POST /documents/{document_id}/chat` - Chat with document (with ownership check)
- `POST /query` - Query document (with ownership check) - Legacy endpoint
- `POST /summary` - Summarize document (with ownership check)
- `POST /emotion` - Analyze emotion (with ownership check)

#### **🔓 Public Endpoints**
- `GET /` - Health check (no auth required)
- `GET /docs` - API documentation (no auth required)

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Authentication Flow**
1. **Firebase ID Token** required in Authorization header
2. **Token validation** via Firebase Admin SDK
3. **User ID extraction** from validated token
4. **Document ownership verification** before operations

### **Security Features**
- **✅ User isolation**: Users can only see their own documents
- **✅ Ownership validation**: All operations check document ownership
- **✅ Proper error handling**: Clear 401/403/404 responses
- **✅ Firebase integration**: Uses existing Firebase authentication

### **Database Schema**
- **✅ `user_id` field**: Links documents to Firebase users
- **✅ Filtering**: All queries filter by user_id
- **✅ Validation**: Ownership checked on every operation

## 🌐 **Production Deployment**

### **Live Application**
- **🔗 URL**: `https://talktoyourdocument-1026546995867.us-central1.run.app`
- **✅ Status**: Successfully deployed with user access control
- **✅ Authentication**: All protected endpoints require Firebase auth
- **✅ Testing**: All authentication tests passed

### **Infrastructure**
- **✅ Google Cloud Run**: Auto-scaling container deployment
- **✅ Google Cloud Storage**: Document storage with user isolation
- **✅ Firebase Authentication**: User management and token validation
- **✅ Production Environment**: `USE_MOCK_STORAGE=false`

## 🔧 **API Usage Examples**

### **Authentication Required**
```bash
# All protected endpoints need Authorization header
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <firebase-id-token>" \
     https://talktoyourdocument-1026546995867.us-central1.run.app/documents
```

### **Document Upload**
```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <firebase-id-token>" \
     -F "file=@document.pdf" \
     https://talktoyourdocument-1026546995867.us-central1.run.app/documents/upload
```

### **Chat with Document**
```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <firebase-id-token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"document_id":"doc-id","query":"What is this about?"}' \
     https://talktoyourdocument-1026546995867.us-central1.run.app/documents/doc-id/chat
```
